    <h2 style="color: yellow;">what is solar system?</h2>
    <p>
      The solar system is made up of the Sun and all the objects that orbit around it, including planets,<br>
      moons, asteroids, comets, and meteoroids. It is located in the Milky Way galaxy and is part of the<br>
      larger universe.<br>

    <h2 style="color: yellow;">components of the solar system</h2>

    <h2 style="color: yellow;">interesting facts about the solar system</h2>
    <p>
      1. The solar system is about 4.6 billion years old.<br>
      2. The Sun contains more than 99% of the total mass of the solar system.<br>
      3. Jupiter is the largest planet in the solar system.<br>
      4. Saturn is known for its prominent ring system.<br>
      5. Earth is the only planet known to support life.<br>
      6. The asteroid belt lies between Mars and Jupiter.<br>
      7. Comets are made of ice, dust, and rocky material and<br>
      often have spectacular tails when they approach the Sun.<br>
      </p>
      <h2 style="color: yellow;">Sun</h2>
      <p>
      The Sun is a star at the center of the solar system. It is a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma, with internal<br>
      convective motion that generates a magnetic field via a dynamo process. The Sun provides the energy necessary <br>
      for life on Earth and drives the climate and weather of our planet.<br>
      </p>
      <h2 style="color: yellow;">Planets</h2>
      <p>
        The solar system has eight recognized planets,<br> 
        which are divided into two categories: Terrestrial planets and Gas giants.<br>
      </p>  
        <h3 style="color: yellow;">Terrestrial planets</h3>
      <p>
        Terrestrial planets are rocky and have solid surfaces. They include Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars.<br>
        These planets are closer to the Sun and have fewer moons compared to the gas giants.<br>  
      </p>
      <h3 style="color: yellow;">Gas giants</h3>
      <p>
        Gas giants are large planets that are primarily composed of hydrogen and helium.<br>
        They include Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. These planets are located farther<br>
         from the Sun and have many moons and ring systems.<br>
      </p>
      <h2 style="color: yellow;">Asteroids</h2>
      <p>
        Asteroids are small, rocky objects that orbit the Sun, primarily found in the asteroid<br>
        belt between Mars and Jupiter. They are considered minor planets and vary greatly in<br>
        size—from tiny pebbles to dwarf planets like Ceres, which spans nearly 1,000 kilometers<br>
        in diameter. Unlike comets, asteroids lack a visible tail and are composed mostly of rock,<br>
        metal, or carbon-rich materials. Scientists classify them into types such as C-type <br>
        (carbonaceous), S-type (silicaceous), and M-type (metallic) based on their composition.<br>
        Studying asteroids helps researchers understand the early solar system, as these bodies<br>
        are remnants from its formation over 4.6 billion years.<br>
      </p>
      <h2 style="color: yellow;">Comets</h2>
      <p>
        Comets are icy bodies that release gas or dust. They originate from the outer regions of<br>
        the solar system, such as the Kuiper Belt and Oort Cloud. When a comet approaches the Sun,<br>
        it heats up and produces a glowing coma and a tail that points away from the Sun. Comets<br>
        are often described as "dirty snowballs" because they are composed of ice, dust, and rocky<br>
        material.<br>
      </p>
      <h2 style="color: yellow;">Moons</h2>
      <p>
        Moons, or natural satellites, are objects that orbit planets and dwarf planets. The solar<br>
        system has over 200 known moons, with some of the most notable being Earth's Moon,<br>
        Jupiter's Ganymede (the largest moon in the solar system), and Saturn's Titan (which has<br>
        a thick atmosphere). Moons vary widely in size, composition, and geological activity.<br>
      </p>
      <h3 style="color: yellow;">Conclusion</h3>
      <p>
        The solar system is a vast and complex collection of celestial bodies, each with its own<br>
        unique characteristics and significance. From the blazing Sun at its center to the distant<br>
        icy comets, the solar system continues to be a subject of fascination and study for scientists<br>
        and enthusiasts alike.<br>
